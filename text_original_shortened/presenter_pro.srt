1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,720
If you've ever recorded speech and afterwards had to transcribe it,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,800
you know that not only is annotating the opposite of exciting,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,360
it's also very time-consuming. But don't worry, you won't have to do that anymore.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
These two things here are what we're going to get out at the end of this video.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,320
An audio file with speech in it and a textgrid with a transcription linking the text to the

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,600
speech. We can achieve this with a super helpful tool for Praat, Presenter Pro.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,320
This is a plugin which lets us prompt, record, and annotate speech all in a few simple steps.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
We will go step by step and I promise that no matter whether you're new to this

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,080
or already a pro, there will be something helpful for you in this video.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:57,600
Many speech researchers carry out recordings in which participants are asked to read aloud

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,360
utterances. So what's the problem? If you record these utterances in one recording session,

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,560
identifying which utterance you want at what point in time will result in considerable and

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,400
time-consuming post-editing because speakers often repeat utterances after they make a mistake.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,160
Typically for a 30-minute recording, you may spend twice the amount of time afterwards

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,160
editing your recordings to identify the specific utterances you want.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,680
Here, prompting software can help. The software prompts a text on the screen that a speaker

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,440
has asked to read. This could be a word or a sentence, for example. It automatically records

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,360
the utterance and saves it for later processing. So, this saves you long and heavy post-processing.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,480
Nowadays, many sophisticated tools can do this, such as speech recorder from LMU or ProRec.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,720
So, why use Presenter Pro? Well, first, Presenter Pro is based on Praat,

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,440
which is platform-independent, meaning you can use it in all operating systems.

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,400
Next, with Presenter Pro, you have a free choice of recording device. You can even use several

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,920
different recording devices at the same time, and all your recordings will automatically be edited.

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,600
Third, Presenter Pro will not cut or save only parts of the recording. It will always leave you

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,680
with a full backup of the entire recording session. And last, the plugin is easy to edit and adapt as

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,040
it was written in Praat's own scripting language, thus requiring no high-end coding knowledge.

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,960
Presenter Pro is a tool created with and for Praat. To use it, you will need to have Praat

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,920
already installed on your computer. If you're new to Praat, we recommend you either check out some

29
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,880
videos from the Uni Freiburg or read about the program in a guide from Will Styler. You will

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,800
find the link to both resources in the description below. To install Presenter Pro, first, you will

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,440
have to download the code. Go to our webpage, maneuver to the repositories, and look for Presenter Pro.

32
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,640
Then, click the code widget and select download zip. Next, open your downloads folder and

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,560
extract the contents of the zipped file. Now, locate your Praat preferences folder and move the

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,040
Presenter Pro folder into your Praat preferences. Once you did that, open the content folder,

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,600
right-click on the setup file, and open it with Praat. This will open Praat and a script. Run the

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,440
script by either clicking on the run button or pressing Command plus R. This will add a menu

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,040
command to your Praat Objects window, with which you can open Presenter Pro comfortably. It's

38
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,560
important not to move the Presenter Pro folder anymore, but to keep it in the Praat preferences.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,480
Click on the menu command to open Presenter Pro. Congratulations! You have successfully installed

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,560
Presenter Pro and made it to the main menu. To run Presenter Pro, we first need a list of

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,440
utterances. When you press on Choose List, a pause menu will appear in which you can select a list

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,080
of utterances you want to use for the experiment. There are some demo lists you can use to give it

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,920
a try, but at some point you will want to create your own list of utterances. To create a new list,

44
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
maneuver back to the content folder, duplicate an already existing list,

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
delete its content, and type in your desired utterances. When you're done, don't forget to

46
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,320
rename your list. Now, if we press on Choose List again, our new list should appear right away.

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,680
Next up, we can name our speaker. This entry will name the textgrid we are about to create

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,320
when starting the application. You can record the utterance either with your own recording device

49
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,240
or use Praat's inbuilt sound recorder. For the latter, press on Record, Mono, or Stereo. This

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,880
will open the sound recorder window. Recording in stereo may come in handy if you want to

51
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,680
additionally record a second signal, for example with a Laryngograph. Make sure that you have

52
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,040
selected the correct input source and sampling frequency. Press on Record to start recording.

53
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
You must leave this window open and running during the experiment.

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,640
Below the recording buttons, you will find the Start From button. It controls which

55
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,960
utterance to first prompt on the screen. Keeping this at one means the first line in

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,440
your list will be shown first. Before you press on Start, make sure that your loudspeakers are

57
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,280
not muted. When you press on Start, Presenter Pro will play a calibration tone. It is important

58
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,600
that the sound is well audible in your recording, as it is a marker to later synchronize the

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,280
recording to the textgrid. Okay, you pressed Start, you should now see a red screen with the first

60
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,000
line of your utterance list. The red screen is the preparation phase. The participant has time to

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
read the utterance before speaking it. Once you press into the red screen, it will turn green.

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,040
This is the speaking phase. The participant should now read aloud the prompted utterance.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,600
Note the arrows and buttons at the bottom of the screen. If, for example, you pressed into the

64
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,760
screen although you weren't ready yet, you can press the left arrow. This will bring you back

65
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,320
to the red screen from before. If you want to repeat the utterance, press on the Repeat button.

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,560
This will also bring you back to the red screen. If you're happy with your production, press the

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,640
right arrow, which will lead you to the next utterance. If you want to exit the experiment

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,400
preemptively, press the Exit button. This will conclude the experiment and bring you back to

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
the main menu. If you press the right arrow on the last utterance of your list, the experiment

70
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,480
will also conclude. Maneuver back to the sound recorder window and stop the recording by pressing

71
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,360
Stop. Then either press on Save to list or Save to list and close. In your objects window, you

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
should now have two objects. Your textgrid file, which is the name you gave it at the beginning,

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,280
and your sound file, which is still called Untitled. Select the sound object and press

74
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,400
View and Edit. This will open the sound editor window where you can modify and analyze your

75
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,040
recording. Remember the calibration tone from before. If everything worked correctly, you should

76
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,320
be able to identify it somewhere at the beginning of your sound, where exactly depends on how much

77
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,960
time it took from starting the recording to starting the experiment. You have two visual

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,520
helpers to find the tone, the waveform and the spectrogram. The waveform will most likely

79
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,640
resemble a block. By clicking into the waveform and dragging it along the x-axis, you can select

80
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,280
a portion of the sound. The calibration tone will be half a second long. We can double check

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,680
whether we found it by checking its duration. In the spectrogram, it will be indicated by a black

82
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,120
line centered around 500 Hertz. Once you have identified the tone, select the beginning of the

83
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,960
sound file up to and including the tone. Press on sel on the bottom of the editor window. This will

84
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,720
zoom in on the selected part. Now, click on the end of the tone and drag your mouse all the way to

85
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,880
the start of the sound. Maneuver to the editor drop down and select Cut or press Command plus X.

86
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,160
This will cut the selected portion of your sound. Close the editor window. Press down the Command

87
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,680
key and select both the textgrid and the sound object. Press on View and Edit. This will open

88
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,480
the editor once more, but now the textgrid will be shown beneath the sound. If everything worked

89
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,360
correctly, the speech will be aligned to the labeled intervals. You can check this by selecting an

90
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,480
interval and playing the sound file by pressing on the tab button. Save your sound as this is not

91
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,120
done automatically. Select the sound and press Save from the drop-down menu. Select Save as WAV

92
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,200
file and save the file where you need it. Do the same for your textgrid object.

93
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,800
You have now learned how to use Presenter Pro. However, the plugin comes with some important

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,680
additional features that you may want to benefit from. Back in the main menu below the start button,

95
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,040
you will find other buttons. I will go from left to right and explain each of them. First, there is

96
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,760
the Help button. When pressed, this button will open a manual where you can read about the functions

97
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,680
of Presenter Pro. What other functions there are, how to get in contact if you notice a bug, how to

98
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,360
deinstall the tool, and its version history. The Settings button will open a menu with some settings

99
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,960
for the display of your list, such as options to display your text differently, or change the font

100
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,920
style and size. If you prepare the list somewhere else on your computer, you could add it with the

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Add List button. This will make a copy of your list in the Presenter Pro folder, but be careful.

102
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,240
If you add a list with the same name as a list within the folder, you will overwrite the already

103
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,200
existing file. The button Remove List will permanently delete the selected list in the List

104
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,640
folder. Be careful not to delete a list you still need, as there is no way of getting it back once

105
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,000
it has been deleted. For the Extract Intervals button, you need to have a sound and its corresponding

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,520
textgrid already selected. This function will create three files for each interval in your text

107
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,400
grid, a text file with the utterance, a WAV file with the sound from the beginning to the end of

108
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,680
the interval, and a corresponding textgrid file, also including the utterance. From the menu,

109
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,880
you can choose your sound format. If your sound is longer than a few minutes, choose Long Sound.

110
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,920
Else, choose Sound. Then, you must specify the write directory. I recommend creating an empty

111
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,160
folder first and writing your files into the folder. Otherwise, you may end up with a mess of

112
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,360
files somewhere on your computer. Once you have inserted your path, press Continue. Then, open

113
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,640
your folder to check whether it worked. If it did, you will have three files per interval. The last

114
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,480
button, textgrids, gives you direct access to your textgrids folder within the Presenter Pro folder.

115
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,080
It lets you choose a textgrid which will then be loaded into the Objects window.

116
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,320
So, that's all folks. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. We are happy to get feedback on what

117
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,800
you liked and what you think we could improve. If you want to know more, make sure to check out

118
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,120

119
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,560
the tool for your research, make sure to cite it. The creator of Presenter Pro has published a short

120
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,680
paper on it. You can find the link together with more information on how to find our resources
