1
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:14,366
It shouldn't be that complicated to
carry out simple edits in a speech corpus.

2
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:18,200
And luckily with databaseExplorer
it isn't.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,200
Learn how to inspect edit,
and save your files

4
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,533
all with just some simple clicks
of your mouse.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,333
Often, speech

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,333
researchers need to handle
a large number of audio files,

7
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,733
and although most steps in your research
plan can be fully automated,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,500
sometimes there is no sleek
and efficient option

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,766
other than to manually check your files
one by one.

10
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:50,033
With databaseExplorer, it is easy to look
through a folder of audio files,

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,466
cut your desired part,
and save it to a new location.

12
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,266
databaseExplorer is a PRAAT

13
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:02,533
plugin, meaning you must have PRAAT already
installed on your computer to use it.

14
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:07,266
If this is not the case, as always,
check out the official website of PRAAT

15
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,600
where you will find
all the information you need.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,866
The link is in the description.

17
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,800
Installing the tool is simple.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,733
Just go to our GitHub website.

19
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:20,066
Locate the databaseExplorer folder
and click on Download as zip.

20
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,333
Once downloaded and extracted,

21
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,833
you'll notice
that there are two scripts in the folder.

22
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:30,166
If you'd like to add a button
to your objects window to open database

23
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,966
Explorer more comfortably, you can open
the installation script and run it.

24
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,633
This will create a copy of the database
Explorer script in your PRAAT preferences

25
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:42,566
directory, and add a button
to your Dynamic Objects window, meaning

26
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:46,333
you will only see the button once you
selected a sound in the objects window.

27
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:51,533
If you don't wish to install the button,
you can simply open databaseExplorer

28
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:55,733
by running the script
called databaseExplorer manually.

29
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,333
To start
databaseExplorer, you need to first load

30
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,133
one of the audio files in the folder
you'd like to look through into your PRAAT

31
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,166
Objects window.

32
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,533
Then select the file and open databaseExplorer.

33
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:08,133
This will open a window

34
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:08,733
This will open a window

35
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:12,533
showing you the waveform and spectrogram
of the currently selected sound.

36
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,333
In your folder.

37
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,300
On the left side of the screen,
you can see a list of the other audio

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,000
files in the folder, and how many files
come before and after the selected file.

39
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,866
On the right side of your screen,

40
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,900
there is a legend showing you
how to use the plugin.

41
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,866
Let's go through the functions one by one.

42
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:33,200
The first three lines tell you
how to select a portion of the sound

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
and cut away the rest.

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,433
Simply click into the waveform
at the point you want your new file

45
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,133
to begin.

46
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,066
Click once more
where you want the file to end.

47
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:45,566
If you missed, just click a third time
and both selections are removed.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,466
Next up.

49
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,766
When you press the spacebar,
the plugin will save the audio

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,200
with the changes
you made to your write directory.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,500
You can choose the write directory
by pressing the W key.

52
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,700
This will open a finder window
in which you can choose the location.

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,800
Your files should be saved

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,166
to press the D key to delete a file
already saved in your write directory.

55
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:08,666
The next five lines tell you how to move
through the files in your folder.

56
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,133
You can use the left and right
arrow keys to move one file up or down.

57
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,266
Pressing the spacebar will also move
you one forward.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,000
However, it will also always save the file
to your right directory.

59
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,800
If you want to make bigger jumps.

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,066
You can use the up and down arrow to jump
three files up and down in your folder.

61
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,966
If that's too fancy for you,
or if your folder contains many files,

62
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:34,433
you can press the G key and manually type
in the file number you want to jump to.

63
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,533
Press the P key
to listen to the currently selected sound.

64
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:41,566
“Die Frau des Apothekers weiss immer was Sie will.”

65
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,200
with the plus and minus keys

66
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,666
You can increase and decrease
the filter bandwidth of your spectrogram.

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,733
This can be useful when you're looking
for specific Formants in your sound.

68
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:54,900
If you have a textgrid file, then
it can be displayed by pressing the T key.

69
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,433
This is a toggle meaning.

70
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,400
By pressing T again,
the textgrid disappears.

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,033
Note that the textgrid and audio file

72
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,866
must have identical file
names for this feature to work.

73
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,866
By pressing the S
key, you can display the settings window.

74
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,533
It lets you choose whether instead

75
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:15,766
of saving your modified files,
it should save the originals.

76
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:19,533
If you select this option,
the modifications you made will show up

77
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:23,800
in an interval tier saved in a textgrid file together with your sound.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,066
If you do this while you have the textgrid selected,

79
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:31,366
databseExplorer will simply combine
your textgrid with the new modifications,

80
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,300
losing no data.

81
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,100
You can also either turn on or off
the function to move on with the spacebar.

82
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,866
This way, when you save a file,

83
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:42,166
you will have to manually move on
with the arrow keys afterwards.

84
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,066
Additionally,

85
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,666
it is possible to change the frequency
ceiling of the displayed spectrogram.

86
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,700
This is especially helpful
when audio has information

87
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,666
in frequency bands
above the default 8000Hz.

88
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:57,066
Finally, when you're done, pat yourself
on the back and press the Q key

89
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,400
to exit the application. Well done.

90
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,200
That's it for this video.

91
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,800
I hope you learned something
and that you had fun.

If you think we missed something

94

If you think we missed something

95
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:09,133
If you think we missed something

96
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:13,200
where you will find all the information

and how to get in touch with us.

98
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,766
This was Clemens
from the LiRI Resource Hub.

99
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:20,766
Keep on exploring
and I hope you have a great day.
